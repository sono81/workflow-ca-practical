                <h1>About us</h1>

                <p>Re-cycle is a relativly new company that focuses on giving our customers eco-friendly, guided cycling tours around different towns in Norway. We have our head seat in Skien, and offices in Bergen, Trondheim and Troms√∏.
                </p>

                <p>We started up in 2018 after Ibnik Hesen tried to be a tourist in his own town and got frustrated how little information it was for tourist to find about the attractions around the area.</p>

                <p>So when he came home frutrated from his experience he started to lay down different routes he could do the next day as an eager cyclist he set the marks within cycling distances.</p>
                <p class="lastParagraph">
                    He found out that this was a quite big task. Wishing there was a place he could go to have this work already set down for him. So he could enjoy a better dinner with his family instead of planning. He got this idea that two months later came into reality, Re-cycle.</p>
